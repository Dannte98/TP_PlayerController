Third Person Controller

DISCLAIMER: This work is based (if not the same) on the controller presented by Brackeys, huge thanks for their help.

-This package uses cinemachine, so make sure its installed before importing this one

-It uses click to move camera.

-Uses primitives as player model, if you are to replace the model, make sure to include the groundCheck
object as a child of the model, positioned at its feet.
